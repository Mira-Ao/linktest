# linktest

test1 include contemporaneous observations with similar RA,Dec. These can be linked 9 objects.
<br/>test2 include contemporaneous observations too, but these are two very different areas of observation. These can be linked 9 object.
<br/>testlarge include the observations are made at different times, in different areas, and with different orbital types of objects. Ultimately, it would be great if we could link all of these at once.
<br/><br/>These are all observations that have already been accepted by submitting identicication to MPC.
